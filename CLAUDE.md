# Claude Code Instructions

## Auto-commit and Push

After completing every user prompt, always:
1. Stage all changes with `git add .`
2. Create a commit with a descriptive message summarizing what was done
3. Push to the remote repository with `git push origin main` (or the current branch)

This ensures all work is continuously saved to the GitHub repository.
